opinionated, yet fast neovim config.

Current benchmarks on M1 Max, 32GB RAM: 26ms with LunarVim/bigfile.nvim, 15ms without (tested with `vim-startuptime`)

This comes as a full package, and I don't have any intention to make it modular.
If you want to use something more customizable refer to NvChad (https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad), SpaceVim (https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim)

Recognitions to glepnir/nvim (https://github.com/glepnir/nvim) and ayamir/nvimdots (https://github.com/ayamir/nvimdots)
as they were the main inspirations for this config.

This configuration currently builds on top of nvim HEAD

Some env variables that can be set:

- PYTHON3_HOST_PROG - python3 executable
- SQLITE_PATH - path to sqlite shared library
